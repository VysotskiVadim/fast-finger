## Workshop preparation
We usually experience difficulties with the Internet connection,
so that it's highly recommended to download all dependencies in advance.

MacOs or Linux
```
./gradlew prepareForWorkshop
```
Windows
```
gradlew.bat prepareForWorkshop
```

## Start local server
MacOs, Linux
```
./gradlew server:run --console=plain
```
Windows
```
gradlew.bat server:run --console=plain
```
