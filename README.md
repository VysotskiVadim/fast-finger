## Workshop preparation
We usually experience difficulties with the Internet connection,
so that it's highly recommended to download all dependencies in advance.

macOS or Linux
```
./gradlew prepareForWorkshop
```
Windows
```
gradlew.bat prepareForWorkshop
```

## Start local server
macOS, Linux
```
./server.sh
```
Windows
```
server.bat
```
